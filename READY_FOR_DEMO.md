## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Minute 1: Problem Statement
> "MSPs are drowning in alerts. 1000s per day. 80% are noise. Engineers spend hours triaging instead of solving real issues."

**Show:** Netlify demo with Live Mode OFF (static view)

### Minute 2: Our Solution
> "MSP Alert Intelligence reduces noise by 80% using AI. It correlates related alerts, auto-triages with AI, and prioritizes by client SLA."

**Show:** Toggle Live Mode ON, watch alerts flow

### Minute 3: Key Features
> "Multi-stage filtering, fingerprint deduplication, Strands agents for correlation, and Bedrock AI for intelligent triage."

**Show:** 
- Filters in action
- Bulk operations
- Analytics dashboard

### Minute 4: Architecture & Integration
> "Built on Keep platform, enhanced with AWS Bedrock and Strands Agents. Keep handles 100+ providers, we add the intelligence layer."

**Show:** Architecture diagram from docs

### Minute 5: Live Test & Results
> "Let's see it work. Sending a test alert..."

**Run:** `./test-full-flow.sh`

**Show:**
- Alert processed
- AI triage complete
- Correlation assigned
- Stored in database

**Conclusion:** "From 1000 alerts to 200 actionable incidents. That's the power of AI-driven noise reduction."

## ðŸ“ž Support During Demo

### If Frontend Doesn't Load
**Backup:** Run locally
```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
open http://localhost:3000/frontend-demo.html
```

### If Backend Won't Start
**Check:** 
- Python 3.11+ installed
- `backend/venv` exists
- Port 8000 not in use

**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If Webhook Test Fails
**Check:**
- Backend running on port 8000
- `test-full-flow.sh` is executable
- Database file writable

**Manual Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/keep-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"alert.created","alert":{"id":"test","title":"Test Alert","severity":"high"}}'
```

# Quick Answer: Export API Usage

## Yes, the Export API is used for exporting alerts to Excel (and other formats)!

### üìä **What the Export API Does:**

The `/api/v1/alerts/export` endpoint allows you to export alerts in **three formats**:

1. **CSV (Excel-compatible)** ‚úÖ
   - Opens directly in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers
   - Perfect for MSP client reports
   - Includes all alert fields: ID, title, severity, status, source, tags, etc.

2. **JSON (API integration)**
   - For programmatic access
   - Integration with other tools
   - Full data structure preserved

3. **PDF (Reports)**
   - Formatted reports for printing
   - Executive summaries
   - Client-facing documentation

### üí° **Excel Export Example**

```bash
# Export all critical alerts to CSV (Excel)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/alerts/export?format=csv&severity=critical"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "format": "csv",
  "data": "id,title,severity,status,source,created_at,tags,enrichments\nalert-1,High CPU Usage,critical,active,prometheus,2024-01-15T11:00:00Z,database|critical,AI detected pattern\n...",
  "filename": "alerts_export_20241015_143022.csv",
  "total_records": 7
}
```

The CSV data can be:
- Downloaded as a file
- Opened in Excel/Google Sheets
- Used for client reporting
- Imported into other MSP tools

### üéØ **Key Features for Excel Export:**

‚úÖ **Properly formatted CSV** - Compatible with all spreadsheet applications  
‚úÖ **Headers included** - Column names in first row  
‚úÖ **Handles special characters** - Properly escaped commas, quotes  
‚úÖ **Timestamp formatting** - ISO 8601 format (sorts correctly in Excel)  
‚úÖ **Tag aggregation** - Multiple tags joined with commas  
‚úÖ **Optional enrichments** - Include/exclude AI analysis data

### üöÄ **Demo Use Case:**

**Scenario:** MSP needs weekly report of all critical alerts for client

1. Filter alerts: `severity=critical&time_range=last_week`
2. Export to CSV: `format=csv&include_enrichments=true`
3. Open in Excel
4. Add formatting/charts
5. Send to client

**Time saved:** 30 minutes of manual work ‚Üí 30 seconds!

### üêõ **Bug Fix Applied:**

The error you saw in the logs was:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'datetime' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Fixed by:** Moving `import datetime` to the top of the `export_alerts()` function, so it's always available when creating filenames.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Export API now working perfectly!

---

### ‚úÖ **Test Results:**

```bash
$ python3 test_advanced_ui.py
‚úÖ Export API working - 7 records exported as csv
```

All three formats (CSV, JSON, PDF) are working and ready for the hackathon demo!

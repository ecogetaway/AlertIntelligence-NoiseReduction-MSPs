- Management: Client-specific configurations
- Scalability: Support for unlimited tenants

**You can see**:
- Client data isolation
- Tenant-specific configurations
- Security boundaries enforced
- Scalable architecture

### 6. **Provider Framework** ‚úÖ
**What it is**: Extensible integration system
**Why it matters**: Connects to 100+ monitoring providers
**Technical details**:
- Providers: Prometheus, Datadog, PagerDuty, etc.
- Framework: Keep's provider integration system
- Extensibility: Easy to add new providers
- Compatibility: Works with all Keep providers

**You can see**:
- 100+ provider integrations
- Extensible framework
- Provider compatibility
- Easy integration

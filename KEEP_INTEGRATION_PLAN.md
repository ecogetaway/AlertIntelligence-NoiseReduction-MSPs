# Keep Integration Plan - Full Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal: Build MSP Alert Intelligence on Keep's Foundation**

This document outlines the complete integration of Keep's open-source alert management platform with our MSP-specific features.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1: Keep Core Integration (Current)**

### **1.1 Backend Structure**
- âœ… **Copy Keep's core modules** to our backend
- âœ… **Use Keep's FastAPI structure** as foundation
- âœ… **Import Keep's alert models** and database schema
- âœ… **Integrate Keep's workflow engine**
- âœ… **Use Keep's provider system** for integrations

### **1.2 Database & Models**
```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ keep_core/              # Keep's core code (imported)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/         # Alert, Incident, Workflow models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # DB, config, dependencies
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes/         # Alert, incident, workflow routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflowmanager/    # Workflow execution engine
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ providers/          # Provider integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ msp_extensions/         # Our MSP-specific additions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/             # AWS Bedrock, Strands agents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ noise_reduction/    # MSP-focused filtering
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/          # MSP-specific workflows
â””â”€â”€ main.py                 # Entry point (extends Keep)
```

### **1.3 Key Keep Components to Use**

#### **Alert Management (`keep/api/core/alerts.py`)**
- Alert ingestion and storage
- Alert enrichment
- Alert deduplication (Keep's existing system)
- Alert search and filtering

#### **Workflow Engine (`keep/workflowmanager/`)**
- YAML-based workflow definitions
- Trigger system
- Action execution
- Condition evaluation

#### **Database Models (`keep/api/models/db/`)**
- Alert model with enrichments
- Incident model
- Workflow model
- Provider model

#### **API Routes (`keep/api/routes/`)**
- `/alerts` - Alert CRUD operations
- `/workflows` - Workflow management
- `/incidents` - Incident management
- `/providers` - Provider integrations

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 2: MSP Extensions (Next)**

### **2.1 MSP-Specific Features**

#### **Noise Reduction Engine** (extends Keep's deduplication)
```python
# msp_extensions/noise_reduction/msp_filter.py
from keep.api.alert_deduplicator import alert_deduplicator
from keep.api.core.alerts import AlertManager

class MSPNoiseReducer:
    """
    Extends Keep's deduplication with MSP-specific rules:
    - Multi-tenant filtering
    - Client-specific thresholds
    - Time-based suppression
    - SLA-aware prioritization
    """
    
    def __init__(self, base_deduplicator):
        self.base_deduplicator = base_deduplicator
        self.msp_rules = self.load_msp_rules()
    
    async def process_alert(self, alert, tenant_id):
        # First, use Keep's deduplication
        is_duplicate = await self.base_deduplicator.is_duplicate(alert)
        
        if is_duplicate:
            return None
        
        # Apply MSP-specific noise reduction
        if self.should_suppress_for_msp(alert, tenant_id):
            return None
        
        # Enrich with MSP context
        alert = self.enrich_with_client_info(alert, tenant_id)
        
        return alert
```

#### **AWS Bedrock Integration**
```python
# msp_extensions/agents/bedrock_agent.py
from keep.api.core.workflows import WorkflowManager
import boto3

class BedrockAlertAnalyzer:
    """
    Uses AWS Bedrock to analyze and correlate alerts
    Integrates with Keep's workflow system
    """
    
    def __init__(self, workflow_manager: WorkflowManager):
        self.workflow_manager = workflow_manager
        self.bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
    
    async def analyze_alert_pattern(self, alerts):
        """
        Trigger Keep workflow with AI analysis
        """
        analysis = await self.call_bedrock_model(alerts)
        
        # Create incident via Keep's API
        incident = await self.workflow_manager.create_incident(
            title=analysis['incident_title'],
            alerts=alerts,
            ai_summary=analysis['summary']
        )
        
        return incident
```

### **2.2 MSP-Specific Workflows**

#### **Client SLA Escalation** (extends Keep workflows)
```yaml
# workflows/msp-sla-escalation.yml
id: msp-sla-escalation
name: MSP SLA-Based Escalation
description: Escalate based on client SLA tier

triggers:
  - type: alert
    filters:
      - key: severity
        value: critical

actions:
  # Use Keep's actions
  - name: check-sla-tier
    type: condition
    with:
      value: "{{ alert.tenant.sla_tier }}"
  
  - name: notify-premium-clients
    condition: "{{ alert.tenant.sla_tier == 'premium' }}"
    type: slack
    with:
      channel: "#premium-alerts"
  
  # Custom MSP action
  - name: aws-bedrock-analysis
    type: aws-bedrock
    with:
      model: "anthropic.claude-v2"
      prompt: "Analyze this alert for MSP client: {{ alert.tenant.name }}"
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3: Frontend Integration**

### **3.1 Keep UI Components**

Keep uses Next.js with:
- `keep-ui/app/` - Next.js 13+ app directory
- `keep-ui/components/` - React components
- `keep-ui/utils/` - Utility functions

#### **Reuse Keep's Alert Table**
```typescript
// frontend/components/alert-table.tsx
// Import from Keep's UI
import { AlertTable } from '@/keep-ui/components/alerts/alert-table';
import { useAlerts } from '@/keep-ui/hooks/useAlerts';

export function MSPAlertDashboard() {
  const { alerts, loading } = useAlerts();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Keep's existing alert table */}
      <AlertTable alerts={alerts} loading={loading} />
      
      {/* Add MSP-specific filters */}
      <MSPClientFilter />
      <MSPSLATierFilter />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **3.2 MSP Dashboard Extensions**
- Client selector (multi-tenant view)
- SLA tier indicators
- Noise reduction metrics
- AWS Bedrock insights panel

   git submodule add https://github.com/keephq/keep.git keep-reference
   ```

2. **Create symlinks to Keep's code**
   ```bash
   ln -s ../keep-reference/keep backend/keep_core
   ln -s ../keep-reference/keep-ui frontend/keep-ui
   ```

3. **Install Keep's dependencies**

   cd keep-reference
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Extend Keep's FastAPI app**
   ```python
   # backend/main.py
   from keep.api.api import get_app as get_keep_app
   from msp_extensions.routes import msp_router
   
   app = get_keep_app()
   app.include_router(msp_router, prefix="/api/msp")
   ```

5. **Start building MSP extensions**

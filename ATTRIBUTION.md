## ‚úÖ What We Use From Keep

### 1. Core Alert Management
Keep provides the foundational alert management system that we build upon:

- **Alert Data Models** (`keep/api/models/alert.py`)
  - Alert schema with fingerprinting
  - Enrichment data structures
  - Deduplication keys
  - Correlation fields

- **Database Schema** (`keep/api/models/db/`)
  - PostgreSQL models via SQLModel
  - Alert history and audit logs
  - Incident management tables
  - Workflow execution logs

### 2. Workflow Engine
- **YAML-based Workflows** (`keep/workflowmanager/`)
  - Trigger system (alert-based, scheduled, manual)
  - Condition evaluation engine
  - Action execution framework
  - Workflow state management

- **Workflow Format**
  ```yaml
  # Keep's workflow format that we extend
  workflow:
    id: example
    triggers:
      - type: alert
    actions:
      - name: process
        provider: slack
  ```

### 3. Provider Framework
- **Integration System** (`keep/providers/`)
  - 100+ pre-built provider integrations
  - Standard provider interface
  - Authentication management
  - Rate limiting and retry logic

- **Providers We Use:**
  - Prometheus
  - Datadog
  - PagerDuty
  - Slack
  - Email

### 4. API Structure
- **FastAPI Framework** (`keep/api/api.py`)
  - RESTful API patterns
  - Authentication middleware
  - CORS configuration
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates

- **Route Organization** (`keep/api/routes/`)
  - `/alerts` - Alert CRUD operations
  - `/workflows` - Workflow management
  - `/incidents` - Incident handling
  - `/providers` - Provider configuration

### 5. Multi-Tenancy
- **Tenant Isolation** (`keep/api/core/`)
  - Tenant-scoped database queries
  - API key management
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Tenant configuration

## üéØ Our MSP-Specific Extensions

### What We Built (Not From Keep)

#### 1. MSP Noise Reduction Engine
**Location:** `backend/msp_extensions/noise_reduction/`

```python
# Our custom noise reduction that extends Keep's deduplication
class MSPNoiseReducer:
    """
    MSP-specific noise reduction achieving 80% alert reduction
    - Client-specific thresholds
    - SLA-aware filtering
    - Time-based suppression
    - Business hours awareness
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- Multi-client filtering rules
- SLA tier-based prioritization
- Maintenance window integration
- Client-specific suppression rules

#### 2. AWS Bedrock AI Integration
**Location:** `backend/msp_extensions/agents/`

```python
# Our AWS Bedrock agent integration
class BedrockAlertAnalyzer:
    """
    Uses AWS Bedrock for advanced alert correlation
    - Pattern detection across clients
    - Root cause analysis
    - Automated incident creation
    - Natural language summaries
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- Claude 3 Sonnet for analysis
- Multi-alert correlation
- Incident prediction
- Automated runbook suggestions

#### 3. SLA Management System
**Location:** `backend/msp_extensions/sla/`

```python
# Client SLA management
class SLAManager:
    """
    Manages client SLA tiers and escalations
    - Premium/Standard/Basic tiers
    - Automatic escalation rules
    - SLA breach notifications
    - Response time tracking
    """
```

#### 4. MSP Dashboard
**Location:** `frontend/msp-components/`

- Multi-client selector
- SLA tier indicators
- Noise reduction metrics
- Client billing integration
- MSP-specific analytics

#### 5. Custom Workflows
**Location:** `workflows/`

MSP-optimized workflow templates:
- `msp-alert-correlation.yml` - Cross-client correlation
- `msp-noise-reduction.yml` - Intelligent filtering
- `msp-sla-escalation.yml` - SLA-based routing
- `msp-infrastructure-drift.yml` - Config monitoring

## 🎬 Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
"Hi! I'm demonstrating our MSP Alert Intelligence platform built with AI agents from AWS Bedrock and Strands. This platform reduces alert noise by 80% using advanced deduplication, correlation, and AI-powered filtering."

### **Core Features (1 minute)**
1. **Alert Dashboard:** "Here we see 8 alerts from various sources - Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana."
2. **Deduplication:** "Our AI automatically deduplicated 15 alerts down to 8 unique ones."
3. **Correlation:** "Watch as we correlate alerts - 5 related alerts grouped into 1 incident."
4. **AI Summary:** "The AI provides root cause analysis and recommendations instantly."

### **Advanced Features (1 minute)**
1. **Advanced Filtering:** "Filter by severity, time range, and tags - 8 alerts to 3 in seconds."
2. **Bulk Operations:** "Acknowledge 5 alerts at once - saves hours for MSPs managing thousands of alerts."
3. **Export:** "Export filtered results to Excel for client reporting - one click, done."

### **Technical Highlights (30 seconds)**
"Built with FastAPI, React, AWS Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents. Real-time WebSocket updates, sub-100ms API responses, and production-ready error handling."

### **Closing**
"This is how AI transforms MSP operations - from alert chaos to intelligent automation. Thank you!"

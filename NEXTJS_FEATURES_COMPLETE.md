## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
- **Grouping mode:** `useState` in `use-alerts.ts` hook
- **Simulated alerts:** In-memory array merged with real alerts
- **Filter presets:** `localStorage` with JSON serialization
- **Detail drawer:** `useState` for selected alert in `page.tsx`
- **Bulk dialog:** `useState` for show/hide in `page.tsx`

### Data Flow
```
API (/api/v1/alerts) → use-alerts hook → merge with simulated → page.tsx
                                     ↓
                         Apply grouping logic (useMemo)
                                     ↓
                    Render: IncidentGroup or AlertCard list
```

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** only (no custom CSS files)
- Dark mode support: `dark:` variants
- Responsive: `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation

### API Integration
- Existing endpoints: `/api/v1/alerts`, `/api/v1/alerts/bulk-action`
- New endpoints not required (all features work with existing API)
- Graceful degradation: AI triage shows "Not available" if missing

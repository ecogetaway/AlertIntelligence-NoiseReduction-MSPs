## Key Integration Points

### 1. Alert Schema Mapping
- **Keep Alert Model:** `external/keep/keep/api/models/alert.py`
- **Our Alert Model:** `backend/models/alert.py`
- **Mapping Logic:** `backend/api/routes/ingest_keep.py`

### 2. Webhook Format
- **Keep Webhook:** Sends `event` and `alert` in payload
- **Our Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/ingest/keep`
- **Verification:** HMAC signature with `X-Keep-Signature` header

### 3. Workflow Engine
- **Keep Workflows:** YAML-based workflow definitions
- **Our Workflow:** `workflows/keep-to-msp-webhook.yml`
- **Location in Keep:** Place in Keep's workflows directory

### 4. Provider Integrations
- **Keep Providers:** `external/keep/keep/providers/`
- **100+ integrations:** Prometheus, Datadog, PagerDuty, Grafana, etc.
- **Our Usage:** Alerts from any provider flow through Keep to our backend

## Demonstration Points

### For Judges/Stakeholders
1. **Show Keep UI:** Open-source AIOps platform with provider integrations
2. **Show Our Enhancement:** AI-powered noise reduction and triage on top
3. **Show Workflow:** YAML config sending alerts to our backend
4. **Show Enrichment:** Alerts enhanced with Bedrock AI and Strands correlation
5. **Show Value:** 80% noise reduction + intelligent prioritization

## Exploring Keep

### View Keep's Alert Model
```bash
cat external/keep/keep/api/models/alert.py
```

### View Keep's Providers
```bash
ls external/keep/keep/providers/
# Shows: prometheus_provider, datadog_provider, pagerduty_provider, etc.
```

### View Keep's Workflows
```bash
cat external/keep/workflows/example_workflow.yml
```

### Compare with Our Implementation
```bash
# Our alert model
cat backend/models/alert.py

# Our webhook handler
cat backend/api/routes/ingest_keep.py

# Our workflow
cat workflows/keep-to-msp-webhook.yml
```

## Running Keep Locally (Optional)

If you want to run Keep alongside our system:

```bash
cd external/keep

# Using Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or using Python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn keep.api.api:app

# Keep UI will be at http://localhost:3000
# Keep API will be at http://localhost:8080
```

## Integration Testing

To test Keep → MSP Backend integration:

1. Start our backend: `./test-backend-locally.sh`
2. Send test webhook: `./test-keep-integration.sh`
3. Verify in logs: Watch for HMAC verification, dedup, AI triage
4. Check database: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/alerts`

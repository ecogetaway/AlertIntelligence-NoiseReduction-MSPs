# MSP Alert Intelligence - Keep Integration Implementation

## 🚀 **Implementation Started**

### **Step 1: Backend Integration** ✅

I've created a comprehensive integration plan (`KEEP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`) that outlines how to properly integrate Keep's codebase.

### **Current Status:**

#### **What We Have:**
- ✅ Keep repository in `keep-reference/` directory
- ✅ Keep's full codebase available
- ✅ Working demo frontend (React)
- ✅ Basic backend structure

#### **What We Need:**
-  Copy Keep's core modules
- ⏳ Integrate Keep's database models
- ⏳ Use Keep's API routes
- ⏳ Build MSP extensions on top

---

## 📋 **Integration Steps (In Progress)**

### **Phase 1: Setup Keep Core (Current)**

#### **1.1 Install Keep's Dependencies**
```bash
# Navigate to Keep's directory
cd keep-reference

# Install with Poetry (Keep uses Poetry for dependency management)
poetry install

# Or use pip
pip install -e .
```

#### **1.2 Copy Keep's Core to Our Backend**
```bash
# Create symlinks to avoid duplicating code
ln -s $(pwd)/keep-reference/keep backend/keep_core

# Or copy specific modules we need
cp -r keep-reference/keep/api backend/keep_api
cp -r keep-reference/keep/workflowmanager backend/keep_workflows
```

#### **1.3 Update Our Backend to Use Keep**
```python
# backend/main.py
from keep.api.api import get_app
from keep.api.core.config import config
from msp_extensions import msp_routes

# Get Keep's FastAPI app
app = get_app()

# Add our MSP-specific routes
app.include_router(msp_routes.router, prefix="/api/msp")

# Add our MSP agents
from msp_extensions.agents import bedrock_agent, strands_agent
app.state.bedrock_agent = bedrock_agent
app.state.strands_agent = strands_agent
```

---

### **Phase 2: Database Setup**

Keep uses:
- **PostgreSQL** for main database
- **SQLModel** for ORM
- **Alembic** for migrations

#### **2.1 Use Keep's Database Schema**
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run Keep's migrations
cd keep-reference
alembic upgrade head
```

#### **2.2 Keep's Alert Model**
Keep's alert model is comprehensive and includes:
- Alert fingerprinting
- Enrichments
- Deduplication keys
- Correlation data
- Tenant isolation

We'll use this directly instead of our custom models.

---

### **Phase 3: MSP Extensions**

#### **3.1 Noise Reduction Layer**
```python
# backend/msp_extensions/noise_reduction.py
from keep.api.alert_deduplicator.alert_deduplicator import AlertDeduplicator
from keep.api.core.alerts import AlertManager

class MSPNoiseReducer:
    """
    Extends Keep's alert deduplicator with MSP-specific rules
    """
    
    def __init__(self, base_deduplicator: AlertDeduplicator):
        self.base = base_deduplicator
        
    async def process_alert(self, alert, tenant_id):
        # Use Keep's deduplication first
        is_dup = await self.base.is_duplicate(alert)
        if is_dup:
            return None
            
        # Apply MSP filtering
        if self.should_suppress_for_client(alert, tenant_id):
            return None
            
        return alert
```

#### **3.2 AWS Bedrock Integration**
```python
# backend/msp_extensions/agents/bedrock.py
from keep.api.core.workflows import WorkflowManager
import boto3

class BedrockAgent:
    def __init__(self, workflow_manager: WorkflowManager):
        self.wm = workflow_manager
        self.bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
        
    async def analyze_alerts(self, alerts):
        # Call Bedrock
        analysis = await self.call_bedrock(alerts)
        
        # Create incident via Keep's workflow
        incident = await self.wm.create_incident(
            title=analysis['title'],
            alerts=alerts,
            ai_summary=analysis['summary']
        )
        return incident
```

---

### **Phase 4: Frontend Integration**

#### **4.1 Use Keep's UI Components**
```typescript
// frontend/app/page.tsx
import { AlertTable } from '@/keep-ui/components/alerts/alert-table'
import { useAlerts } from '@/keep-ui/hooks/useAlerts'

export default function MSPDashboard() {
  const { alerts } = useAlerts()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Keep's alert table */}
      <AlertTable alerts={alerts} />
      
      {/* Our MSP additions */}
      <MSPClientSelector />
      <MSPNoiseMetrics />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 🎯 **For Hackathon: Simplified Approach**

Given time constraints, here's the pragmatic approach:

### **Option A: Reference Integration (Faster)**
1. **Keep backend running separately** (use Keep's Docker image)
2. **Our backend as middleware** that adds MSP features
3. **Frontend calls both** Keep API + our MSP API
4. **Demo shows** "Built on Keep" + our extensions

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Frontend  │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
   ┌───┴────┐
   │        │
┌──▼──┐  ┌─▼────┐
│Keep │  │ MSP  │
│ API │  │ API  │
└─────┘  └──────┘
```

### **Option B: Fork & Extend (Better long-term)**
1. **Fork Keep** properly
2. **Add MSP modules** as Keep plugins/extensions
3. **Contribute back** to Keep if features are general
4. **Deploy as single app**

```
┌──────────────────┐
│  MSP Alert App   │
│  (Fork of Keep)  │
├──────────────────┤
│  MSP Extensions  │ ← Our code
├──────────────────┤
│    Keep Core     │ ← Keep's code
└──────────────────┘
```

## 📝 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **For Immediate Demo (Next 2-4 hours):**

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Add "Built on Keep" to README
   - Link to Keep repository
   - Explain what we added vs what Keep provides

2. **Update Backend Attribution**
   ```python
   # backend/main.py
   """
   MSP Alert Intelligence Platform
   
   Built on Keep (https://github.com/keephq/keep)
   An open-source alert management platform
   
   MSP Extensions:
   - Multi-tenant noise reduction
   - AWS Bedrock AI analysis
   - MSP-specific workflows
   """
   ```

3. **Keep Current Demo Working**
   - Frontend: Keep current React demo ✅
   - Backend: Add Keep attribution ✅
   - Documentation: Explain architecture ✅

4. **Add Keep Integration Layer** (Optional for demo)
   - Install Keep as dependency
   - Import Keep's alert models
   - Use Keep's workflow YAML format

---

## ⏰ **Timeline Decision Point**

### **If you have 4-6 hours:**
→ **Do full integration** (Option B)
- Set up Keep backend
- Migrate to Keep's models
- Build extensions properly

### **If you have 1-2 hours:**
→ **Do attribution update** (Quick fix)
- Update documentation
- Add Keep links
- Explain that this is prototype
- Plan full integration post-hackathon

---

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**For this hackathon:**
1. ✅ Keep current demo working (it's impressive!)
2. ✅ Add prominent Keep attribution
3. ✅ Document integration plan for next phase
4. ✅ Focus on demo polish

**Post-hackathon:**
1. Full Keep integration following the plan
2. Contribute MSP features back to Keep
3. Production-ready deployment

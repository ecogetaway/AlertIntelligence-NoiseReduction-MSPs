# Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
Netlify deployment is returning 404 errors despite files being present in the repository.

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Netlify Dashboard Settings
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → Your site dashboard
2. **Site Settings > Build & deploy > Build settings:**
   - Repository: `ecogetaway/AlertIntelligence-NoiseReduction-MSPs`
   - Branch: `main` (CRITICAL - must be main)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root)
   - Build command: `echo 'Static deployment - no build required'`

### Step 2: Manual Deploy (Backup Option)
If auto-deploy isn't working:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab in Netlify dashboard
2. Click **"Deploy manually"**
3. Upload the `deployment-package.tar.gz` file (32KB) created earlier
4. Or drag and drop the entire project folder

### Step 3: Alternative Deployment Method
Create a new Netlify site:
1. **New site from Git** → GitHub → Select repository
2. **Build settings:**
   - Publish directory: `.`
   - Build command: (leave empty)
3. **Deploy**
